# Project Results Directory Structure

This document provides an overview of the results structure for our experiments, located in the `results/` directory. Each subdirectory within `results/` corresponds to a specific configuration and is organized as follows:

## Directory Naming Convention

Each results folder is named using the following format:

`mode_<prompt_mode>model<llm_model>run<run_number>`


- `<prompt_mode>`: Represents the mode of prompting used during the experiment.
- `<llm_model>`: Specifies the large language model (LLM) used (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama 3.1).
- `<run_number>`: Indicates the run number for cases where multiple runs were conducted. (Only applcible for Llama 3.1)

## Folder Structure

Within each configuration folder, the following subdirectories and files will be created after running experiments:

### 1. **`compile_results/`**
   - This folder contains logs and summaries of compilation attempts for the generated patches.
   - It tracks all compilation failures encountered during the patch application process.

### 2. **`generated_patches/`**
   - Stores all patches generated by the LLM for each bug in the dataset.
   - These patches represent the direct output from the LLM before any evaluation or modification.

### 3. **`linux_patches/`**
   - Contains diff files created by comparing the buggy files before and after applying the generated patches.
   - These diffs help visualize and analyze the changes made by the LLM.

### 4. **`suggestion_prompts/`**
   - Holds all the prompts used as input to the LLM.
   - Each prompt corresponds to a specific bug and contains detailed instructions and context for the LLM.

### 5. **`test_results/`**
   - Includes logs of terminal outputs for all test failure cases.
   - These outputs provide detailed information about why certain patches failed during testing.

### 6. **`test_results_mode_<mode_number>.csv`**
   - A comprehensive CSV file that categorizes the outcome for each bug in the dataset:
     - **Pass**: Indicates the patch successfully passed all tests.
     - **Test Failure**: Indicates the patch failed one or more tests.
       - The CSV also marks which specific tests failed in these cases.
     - **Compilation Failure**: Indicates the patch could not be compiled successfully.

### 7. **`test_statistics_mode_<mode_number>.csv`**
   - A CSV file displaying the statistics of the following:
     - **Pass Rate**: The percentage of bugs that were patched by our tool in this run.
     - **Total Passes**: Number of successful patches that passed all tests.
     - **Total Test Failures**: Number of incorrect patches that passed compilation but failed the tests.
     - **Total Compile Failures**: Number of incorrect patches that failed compilation.
     - **Total Bugs**: Number bugs tested.
     
## Usage

This directory structure is designed to facilitate easy access and analysis of the experimental results. Researchers can:
- Navigate the `compile-results` folder to investigate compilation issues.
- Refer to the `generated-patches` folder to study the exact code output made by the LLM.
- Use the `results.csv` file for high-level categorization and summary of the experimental outcomes.
